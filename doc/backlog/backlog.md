# New Requirements — Backlog & Analysis

Forward-looking implementation items. Each item is classified by priority,
complexity, and dependency. Before implementation, follow the
[Implementation Process](#implementation-process) below.

## Item Index

**Next R number: R50** — Bump this line in the same commit when adding a new item.

### High Priority

*(none currently)*

### Medium Priority

**Complexity — Medium:**
- **[R32](R32-kv-custom-rust-rpc.md)** — Custom Rust RPC library to replace gRPC on the hot path — Area:
  RPC / consensus — gRPC (tonic + h2) serializes concurrent writers on a
  connection-level userspace lock (HPACK table, frame buffer,
  flow-control windows); measured cost is ~17% at 2T:1C, zero at
  1T:1C. A custom `[len][req_id][protobuf]`-over-raw-TCP transport
  removes the userspace funnel — the kernel TCP lock is the only
  serialization point. **Deferred until** read throughput is the
  primary constraint AND the h2 lock is profiled as the hot spot; until
  then write-path (R16a/R17) and disk-I/O work take precedence.
  High complexity (2–4K lines: framing, pool, reconnect, timeout,
  cancellation, backpressure, TLS). Scope is the internal
  replica-to-replica path only; management API stays on Axum/HTTP.
  Reference implementations: protosocket (Momento), Volo (CloudWeGo),
  Cap'n Proto RPC.
- **[R33](R33-crow-tree-rename.md)** — Extract crow-tree to separate repo and rename — Area:
  workspace — Move `crowtree/` into its own git repository (preserving
  history), wire `crow-kv` to depend on `crow-tree-ffi` as an external
  dependency, and rename the crate/namespace/macros from `crowtree` to
  `crow-tree` / `crow::tree` / `CROW_TREE_*`. Establishes the `crow-kv` →
  `crow-tree` dependency boundary analogous to `crow-kv` → `crow-common`.
  Most naturally done after R12.
- **[R39](R39-kv-read-endpoint-policy.md)** — Least-conn / latency read-endpoint policy — Area:
  read path / client — R26's `AnyReplica` is round-robin (blind
  rotation); a slow replica drags p99 for 1/N of MinSlot reads. New
  `LeastConnections` (per-endpoint in-flight) and `Latency` (per-endpoint
  RTT EWMA) policies route by actual capacity. Medium complexity;
  client-local state, no server change.
- **[R48](R48-scan-lazy-l0-cursor.md)** — Scan lazy/range-bounded L0 cursor — Area:
  scan / crow-tree engine — `MemTable::snapshot()` copies all N_l0
  entries on every scan (O(N_l0), not O(limit)). Originally scoped as
  the 1KiB anomaly fix, but R47's `--flush-after-prepopulate`
  experiment refuted the L0 premise (draining L0 did not close the
  3.2x gap; the maintenance loop's 3s tick already keeps L0 small).
  R48 would still make L0 cost O(limit) but would not fix the
  anomaly; the real root cause is unknown and needs an engine-level
  investigation first. Medium complexity.
- **[R49](R49-scan-streaming-response.md)** — Scan streaming gRPC response — Area:
  scan / RPC — tonic's 4 MiB max message size caps scan payload
  (full_100k, 16KiB values fail). Server-streaming Scan RPC emits
  entries in chunks, mirroring etcd PR #19766. Medium-high complexity;
  composes with R38 (zero-copy values) for full large-scan solution.
### Low Priority

**Complexity — Low (placeholder):**
- **[R5](R5-rdma-alloc.md)** — RDMA-pinned allocation — Blocked by: RDMA backend — Area: crowtree
  engine — `buffer::allocate` seam is designed for RDMA-pinned memory but no
  RDMA backend exists yet; placeholder only.

**Complexity — Medium:**
- **[R4](R4-bounded-mempool.md)** — Bounded memory pool — Area: crowtree engine — `buffer::allocate` uses
  unbounded `std::malloc`; a burst of large writes can spike RSS without
  backpressure.

## Implementation Process

Each item follows the lifecycle defined in the
[`/implement-requirement` workflow](../../.devin/workflows/implement-requirement.md):
understand → design → plan → implement → merge design → cleanup.

After the PR is merged, all obsolete working docs (design draft, plan doc)
must be deleted — see the workflow's Post-merge cleanup section.
