### R5: RDMA-pinned allocation

**Problem**: `buffer::allocate` seam (`buffer.h:232`) is designed to swap
`std::malloc` for RDMA-pinned memory, but no RDMA backend exists.

**Priority**: Low — placeholder for future RDMA `BlockPageStore` medium.

**Complexity**: Low (the placeholder itself) — just keep the allocator seam
and document the intended interface. High when the RDMA backend itself is
built (separate effort).

**Blocked by**: RDMA `BlockPageStore` medium (not started).

**Files**: `crowtree/include/crowtree/buffer.h` (seam only)

**Acceptance**: N/A until RDMA backend exists. Seam remains intact.
